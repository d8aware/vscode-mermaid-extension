## 1.0.2
- Changed the placement of the "Generate Class Diagram" command.  It is now in the group further down the context menu instead of the first item.
- Moved the priority of the "View Diagram" button to be higher to ensure that the icon is visible when other extensions are active that also target MMD files.
